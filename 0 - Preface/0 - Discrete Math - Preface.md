# Themes of Discrete Math
- consists of individual (discrete) steps in contrast to calculous which studies processes of change
- Main themes are:
	- Logic and proof
	- induction 
	- recursion
	- Combinatorics
	- discrete probability
	- algorithms and their analysis
	- discrete structures
	- applications and modeling


## Logic and Proof
- Using logically valid forms of argument
- avoid logical errors
- reason from definition
- direct and indirect argument
- derive new results from already known truths


## Induction and Recursion
- solve a problem by assuming that similar problems of a smaller nature have already been solved and putting those solutions together to solve a larger problem

## Combinatorics and Discrete Probability
- Combinatorics: counting and arranging objects
- Discrete probability: e.g. finding the probability of a certain number of heads given a certain number of coin flips

## Algorithms and their Analysis
- Algorithm: step by step sequence used to solve a problem
- Analysis: you will need to use mathamatical induction to determine correctness. Time and memory space of a solution is determined using Combinatorics, recurrence relations, functions and O- notation.

## Discrete Structures
- these are the abstract structures that describe, catagorise and reveal the relationships underlying math objects

## Applications and Modeling
- the book will focus on the practical applications of math
- one mathamatical model can be used to solve entirely distinct practical problems
